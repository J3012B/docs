## Welcome

As of the date of this writing (07/21/2024), Calendly does not offer a way to automatically schedule events via its API (see [Calendly API reference](https://developer.calendly.com/api-docs)).
With our API, you can schedule events directly in Calendly. Learn how to automate your Calendly scheduling.
